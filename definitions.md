# Definitions

### Agent

An Agent refers to any active participant within the game world. This term encompasses all Characters, non-player characters, monsters, and other entities capable of taking actions, influencing the narrative, or interacting with the game mechanics.

Agents can be classified into:
- Player Characters: Characters controlled by the players.
- Non-player Characters: Story-driven characters controlled by the Game Master (or equivalent role).
- Foes: Monsters, or  non-player character adversaries that challenge or oppose the players.

Regardless of their classification, all Agents share common traits and mechanics, such as attributes, abilities, and actions, making the term a unifying concept for all beings in the game world.

### Character

A Character is any Agent with a defined identity, personality, and role within the story or gameplay. Characters can be either Player Characters or Non-player Characters, each serving distinct purposes:
- Player Characters (PCs): Characters created and controlled by players. They are the primary protagonists of the story and directly influenced by player decisions, growth, and actions.
- Non-player Characters (NPCs): Characters controlled by the Game Master (or equivalent role). They populate the world, provide narrative context, and may serve as allies, neutral parties, or adversaries.

While both Player Characters and Non-player Characters share core mechanics such as attributes, abilities, and actions, their control and narrative significance differ. Together, they form the driving forces behind the stories and challenges within LibreSphere.

### Foes

Foes are hostile agents that oppose the Player Characters (PCs) and create obstacles, challenges, or threats within the game. Foes can take many forms, from monstrous creatures and malevolent entities to rival factions or corrupted individuals, each with their own motivations for conflict.

Foes are often adversaries in combat but can also present challenges through intrigue, deception, or other forms of resistance. While some Foes are driven by malice or evil intent, others may simply be acting in accordance with their own goals, beliefs, or survival instincts. Regardless of their motivations, Foes stand as primary antagonists in the narrative, testing the will and abilities of the PCs.

### Game Master

The Game Master (GM) is the central storyteller, moderator, and guide of the game. The GM controls the world, its narrative, and all Non-player Characters (NPCs) and environmental elements, creating the setting in which the Players’ characters interact.

The GM plays a pivotal role in creating an immersive and collaborative experience for the Players, helping to bring the game world to life and making sure the adventure is both challenging and enjoyable.

### Player

A Player is an individual who participates in the game by controlling one or more Player Characters (PCs). Players engage with the game world, make decisions for their characters, and contribute to the progression of the narrative. Through their actions, choices, and interactions with other players and the Game Master (GM), Players shape the events and outcomes of the story.

A Player’s primary role is to bring their Player Character to life, deciding how they will navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the world of LibreSphere. Players are also key collaborators in the shared storytelling experience, working together with other players and the GM to create a dynamic and evolving narrative.
