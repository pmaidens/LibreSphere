# Combat

Combat is played in a series of rounds. The number of rounds that are played is determined by how long all the combat partisipants wish to stay engaged in the combat. Once only one side of the combat remains, the combat is over.

## Combat Step Sequence

## Steps

### Combat Start

Any abilities or conditions that trigger at the start of combat will occur now.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, we transition to the next step.

### Round Start

Any abilities or conditions that trigger at the start of the round occur now.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, we transition to the next step.

### Hand Selection

Each round begins with each [Agent](/definitions/#agent) choosing a hand from the cards in their ability deck. The number of cards that a player can take in their hand is variable and can be found on your character sheet.

Once all [Agents](/definitions/#agent) have chosen their hands, this step ends and we move onto the next step.

### Turn Start

Any abilities or conditions that trigger at the start of the turn occur now.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, we transition to the next step.

### Card Selection

During this step, each [Agent](/definitions/#agent) who still has cards in their hand chooses a single card from their hand and lays it face down where all other players can see the back of it.

Once all [Agents](/definitions/#agent) who are able to have selected the card, we move onto the next step.

### Determine Initiative

At the start of this step, all [Agents](/definitions/#agent) turn over the card they selected during the Card Selection step to show the ability side of the card. The initiative values of all the cards are then compared. The [Agent](/definitions/#agent) with the ability card with the highest initiative value gets "Initiative".

Once the [Agent](/definitions/#agent) with Initiative has been determined, move on to the next step.

### Perform Ability

The [Agent](/definitions/#agent) with Initiative performs the ability on their revealed ability card.

[We need to add more information about how this is done somewhere.]: #

### Turn End

Any conditions or abilities that trigger during the end of the turn trigger now.

The [Agent](/definitions/#agent) who has Initiative is given the [Winded](/rules/conditions/winded#winded) condition, and loses Initiative.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, we need to determine which step to go to. If there are [Agents](/definitions/#agent) who still have cards in their hand, we transition to the Turn Start step. Otherwise, we transition to the Round End step.

### Round End

Any abilities or conditions that trigger at the end of the round occur now.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, we need to determine which step to go to. If there is still [Agents](/definitions/#agent) who are hostile to one another, we transition to the Round Start step. Otherwise, we transition to the Combat End step.

### Combat End

Any abilities or conditions that trigger at the end of the combat occur now.

Once all abilities and conditions have triggered, the combat ends.
