# Definitions

### Agent

An Agent refers to any active participant within the game world. This term encompasses all Characters, monsters, and other entities capable of taking actions, influencing the narrative, or interacting with the game mechanics.

Agents can be classified into:
- [Player Characters](#player-characters-pcs): Characters controlled by the [players](#player).
- [Allies](#allies): Story-driven [non-player characters](#non-player-characters-npcs) controlled by the [Game Master](#game-master-gm).
- [Foes](#foes): Monsters, or  [non-player character](#non-player-characters-npcs) adversaries that challenge or oppose the players.

Regardless of their classification, all Agents share common traits and mechanics, such as attributes, abilities, and actions, making the term a unifying concept for all beings in the game world.

### Allies

Allies are [agents](#agent) who support or align with the [Player Characters (PCs)](#player-characters-pcs), assisting them in their quests, battles, or goals. Allies can take many forms, such as loyal companions, powerful mentors, friendly factions, or neutral parties with overlapping interests.

Allies may contribute to the story by providing resources, knowledge, or aid during pivotal moments. While their motivations and relationships with the PCs may vary, Allies are united by their shared purpose or alignment with the [PCs’](#player-characters-pcs) objectives.

Some Allies may have their own goals and conflicts, creating opportunities for collaboration, roleplay, and deeper narrative engagement. Whether they serve as temporary partners or lifelong companions, Allies enrich the story and enhance the [PCs’](#player-characters-pcs) journey.

### Character

A Character is any [Agent](#agent) with a defined identity, personality, and role within the story or gameplay. Characters can be either Player Characters or [Non-player Characters](#non-player-characters-npcs), each serving distinct purposes:

#### Player Characters (PCs)

Characters created and controlled by [players](#player). They are the primary protagonists of the story and directly influenced by [player](#player) decisions, growth, and actions.

#### Non-player Characters (NPCs)

Characters controlled by the [Game Master](#game-master-gm). They populate the world, provide narrative context, and may serve as [allies](#allies), neutral parties, or [foes](#foes).

While both [Player Characters](#player-characters-pcs) and [Non-player Characters](#non-player-characters-npcs) share core mechanics such as attributes, abilities, and actions, their control and narrative significance differ. Together, they form the driving forces behind the stories and challenges within LibreSphere.

### Foes

Foes are hostile [agents](#agent) that oppose the [Player Characters (PCs)](#player-characters-pcs) and create obstacles, challenges, or threats within the game. Foes can take many forms, from monstrous creatures and malevolent entities to rival factions or corrupted individuals, each with their own motivations for conflict.

Foes are often adversaries in combat but can also present challenges through intrigue, deception, or other forms of resistance. While some Foes are driven by malice or evil intent, others may simply be acting in accordance with their own goals, beliefs, or survival instincts.

### Game Master (GM)

The Game Master (GM) is the central storyteller, moderator, and guide of the game. The GM controls the world, its narrative, and all [Non-player Characters (NPCs)](#non-player-characters-npcs) and environmental elements, creating the setting in which the [Players’](#player) [characters](#character) interact.

The GM plays a pivotal role in creating an immersive and collaborative experience for the [Players](#player), helping to bring the game world to life and making sure the adventure is both challenging and enjoyable.

### Player

A Player is an individual who participates in the game by controlling one or more [Player Characters (PCs)](#player-characters-pcs). Players engage with the game world, make decisions for their characters, and contribute to the progression of the narrative. Through their actions, choices, and interactions with other players and the [Game Master (GM)](#game-master-gm), Players shape the events and outcomes of the story.

A Player’s primary role is to bring their [Player Character](#player-characters-pcs) to life, deciding how they will navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the world of LibreSphere. Players are also key collaborators in the shared storytelling experience, working together with other players and the [GM](#game-master-gm) to create a dynamic and evolving narrative.
